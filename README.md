# ECE-353-Final-Project
Brent Drazner and mine's final project for ECE 353, Intro to Microprocessor Systems. We implemented the Space Invaders game on an embedded 
system. The hardware we used includes a PS2 joystick, an LCD touchscreen, an IO port expander, and various other devices. Video 
demonstration of our project can be found on YouTube: https://youtu.be/HmdPb6JGf7g

This repository does not contain all the needed code; about half of the files were coded during in-class exercises and do not belong to 
us. The files that are uploaded, however, were made by us.
