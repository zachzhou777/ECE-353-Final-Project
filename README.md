# ECE-353-Final-Project
Brent Drazner and mine's final project for ECE 353, Intro to Microprocessor Systems. We implemented Space Invaders on the an embedded 
system. Video demonstration of our project can be found on YouTube: https://youtu.be/HmdPb6JGf7g

This repository does not contain all the needed code; about half of the files were coded during in-class exercises and do not belong to 
us. The files that are uploaded, however, were made by us.
